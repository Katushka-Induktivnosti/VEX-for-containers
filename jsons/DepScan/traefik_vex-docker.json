Users should migrate to the V1 EncryptionClientV2 API, which will not create vulnerable files. Old files will remain vulnerable until re-encrypted with the new client.\n\n## Related CVE(s)\nCVE-2020-8911, CVE-2020-8912, GHSA-7f33-f4f5-xwgw, GHSA-f5pg-7wfw-84q9", "related_urls": ["https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/updates-to-the-amazon-s3-encryption-client/?s=09", "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/pull/3403", "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/commit/ae9b9fd92af132cfd8d879809d8611825ba135f4"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}
