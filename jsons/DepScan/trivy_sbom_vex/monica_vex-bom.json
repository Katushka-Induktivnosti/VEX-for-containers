folder creation process, Basicly if you provide node-tar with a path like this `./a/b/c/foo.txt` it would create every folder and sub-folder here a, b and c until it reaches the last folder to create `foo.txt`, In-this case I noticed that there's no validation at all on the amount of folders being created, that said we're actually able to CPU and memory consume the system running node-tar and even crash the nodejs client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nYou can reproduce this issue by downloading the tar file I provided in

If a duplicated transfer's easy_handle has cookies enabled when it is duplicated, the cookie-enabled state is cloned but the actual cookies are not.

In cases where the hostname is greater than 255 characters in length, curl will instead attempt to perform the resolution locally and then pass the resolved IP to the proxy for its use. Due to an issue in the curl source code, the logic that determines whether curl should resolve the name locally or pass it to the proxy for resolution could make an incorrect decision when a slow SOCKS5 handshake occurs.

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level.
