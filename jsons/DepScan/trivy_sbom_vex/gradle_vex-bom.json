This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths.

folder creation process, Basicly if you provide node-tar with a path like this `./a/b/c/foo.txt` it would create every folder and sub-folder here a, b and c until it reaches the last folder to create `foo.txt`, In-this case I noticed that there's no validation at all on the amount of folders being created, that said we're actually able to CPU and memory consume the system running node-tar and even crash the nodejs client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nYou can reproduce this issue by downloading the tar file I provided in

In Git Plugin 4.11.3 and earlier, this endpoint can be accessed with GET requests and without authentication.\n\nThis webhook endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nGit Plugin 4.11.4 requires a `token` parameter which will act as an authentication for the webhook endpoint.
