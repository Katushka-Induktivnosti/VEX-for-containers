This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths.

{"id": "CVE-2022-31159", "package": "com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-s3", "purl": "pkg:maven/com.amazonaws/aws-java-sdk-s3@1.11.948", "package_type": "com.amazonaws", "package_usage": "N/A", "version": "1.11.948", "fix_version": "1.12.261", "severity": "HIGH", "cvss_score": "7.9", "short_description": "# Partial Path Traversal in com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-s3 \n### Overview\n\nA partial-path traversal issue exists within the `downloadDirectory` method in the AWS S3 TransferManager component of the AWS SDK for Java v1. Applications using the SDK control the `destinationDirectory` argument, but S3 object keys are determined by the application that uploaded the objects. The `downloadDirectory` method allows the caller to pass a filesystem object in the object key but contained an issue in the validation logic for the key name. A knowledgeable actor could bypass the validation logic by including a UNIX double-dot in the bucket key. Under certain conditions, this could permit them to retrieve a directory from their S3 bucket that is one level up in the filesystem from their working directory. \n\nThis issue\u2019s scope is limited to directories whose name prefix matches the destinationDirectory. E.g. for destination directory`/tmp/foo`, the actor can cause a download to `/tmp/foo-bar`, but not `/tmp/bar`. \n\nVersions of the AWS Java SDK for S3 v1 before and including v1.12.260 are affected by this issue. \n\n### Impact\n\nIf `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` is used to download an untrusted buckets contents, the contents of that bucket can be written outside of the intended destination directory.\n\n#### Root Cause\n\nThe `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` contains a partial-path traversal vulnerability.\n\nThis is due to the guard logic in `leavesRoot` containing an insufficient protection against partial-path traversal.\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/5be0807af763b9fbf6b0a153c76dd305e407f035/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L1513-L1519\n\nThe application controls the `localBaseDirectory` argument, but the `key` comes from the AWS bucket entry (ie. can be attacker controlled). The above bit of logic can be bypassed with the following payloads:\n\n```java\n// The following will return 'false', although the attacker value will \"leave\" the `/usr/foo` directory\nleavesRoot(new File(\"/usr/foo\"), \"/../foo-bar/bar\")\n```\n\nThis guard is used here which should guard against path traversal, however `leavesRoot` is an insufficient guard:\n\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/ae88c8aa4b195047b94c154897475f85642d7eb3/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java#L1420-L1423\n\n#### True Root cause\n\n If the result of `parent.getCanonicalPath()` is not slash terminated it allows for partial path traversal.\n\n> Consider `\"/usr/outnot\".startsWith(\"/usr/out\")`. The check is bypassed although `outnot` is not under the `out` directory.\nThe terminating slash may be removed in various places. On Linux `println(new File(\"/var/\"))` returns `/var`, but `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\"))` - `/var/`, however `println(new File(\"/var\", \"/\").getCanonicalPath())` - `/var`.\n \\- [@JarLob (Jaroslav Loba\u010devski)](https://github.com/JarLob)\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to the AWS SDK for Java >= 1.12.261, if you are on a version < 1.12.261.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen calling `com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` pass a `KeyFilter` that forbids `S3ObjectSummary` objects that `getKey` method return a string containing the substring `..` .\n\n### References\n\nSimilar vulnerabilities:\n - ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23457\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact [AWS's Security team](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/security/advisories/GHSA-c28r-hw5m-5gv3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31159", "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/commit/cb66c50c885566d9a7fce837a68dc48ddced8a9a", "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

This security flaw happens when curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from an HTTP(S) server, where it accepts cookies using control codes (byte values below 32), and also when cookies that contain such control codes are later sent back to an HTTP(S) server, possibly causing the server to return a 400 response. This issue effectively allows a \"sister site\" to deny service to siblings and cause a denial of service attack.\n\nCVE-2022-32208:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because it mishandles message verification failures when curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-in-the-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows data injection into the client.\n\nCVE-2022-32207:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when curl saves cookies, alt-svc, and HSTS data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the process with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name. This flaw leads to unpreserved file permissions, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32206:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the number of acceptable \"links\" in the \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32205:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl.

As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems.\n\nThe method `File.createTempFile` on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information.\n\nThis is the case in netty's `AbstractDiskHttpData` is vulnerable.\n\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/e5951d46fc89db507ba7d2968d2ede26378f0b04/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/multipart/AbstractDiskHttpData.java#L80-L101\n\n`AbstractDiskHttpData` is used as a part of the `DefaultHttpDataFactory` class which is used by `HttpPostRequestDecoder` / `HttpPostMultiPartRequestDecoder`.\n\nYou may be affected by this vulnerability your project contains the following code patterns:\n\n```java\nchannelPipeline.addLast(new HttpPostRequestDecoder(...));\n```\n\n```java\nchannelPipeline.addLast(new HttpPostMultiPartRequestDecoder(...));\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in version `4.1.59.Final`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSpecify your own `java.io.tmpdir` when you start the JVM or use `DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)` to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.\n\n### References\n\n - [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)\n - [CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)\n\n### Similar Vulnerabilities\n\nSimilar, but not the same.\n\n - JUnit 4 - https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\n - Google Guava - https://github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\n - Apache Ant - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1945\n - JetBrains Kotlin Compiler - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15824\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)\n* Email us [here](mailto:netty-security@googlegroups.com)\n\n### Original Report\n\n> Hi Netty Security Team,\n> \n> I've been working on some security research leveraging custom CodeQL queries to detect local information disclosure vulnerabilities in java applications. This was the result from running this query against the netty project:\n> https://lgtm.com/query/7723301787255288599/\n> \n> Netty contains three local information disclosure vulnerabilities, so far as I can tell.\n> \n> One is here, where the private key for the certificate is written to a temporary file.\n> \n> https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/e5951d46fc89db507ba7d2968d2ede26378f0b04/handler/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/ssl/util/SelfSignedCertificate.java#L316-L346\n> \n> One is here, where the certificate is written to a temporary file.\n> \n> https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/e5951d46fc89db507ba7d2968d2ede26378f0b04/handler/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/ssl/util/SelfSignedCertificate.java#L348-L371\n> \n> The final one is here, where the 'AbstractDiskHttpData' creates a temporary file if the getBaseDirectory() method returns null. I believe that 'AbstractDiskHttpData' is used as a part of the file upload support? If this is the case, any files uploaded would be similarly vulnerable.\n> \n> https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/e5951d46fc89db507ba7d2968d2ede26378f0b04/codec-http/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/http/multipart/AbstractDiskHttpData.java#L91\n> \n> All of these vulnerabilities exist because `File.createTempFile(String, String)` will create a temporary file in the system temporary directory if the 'java.io.tmpdir' system property is not explicitly set. It is my understanding that when java creates a file, by default, and using this method, the permissions on that file utilize the umask. In a majority of cases, this means that the file that java creates has the permissions: `-rw-r--r--`, thus, any other local user on that system can read the contents of that file.\n> \n> Impacted OS:\n> - Any OS where the system temporary directory is shared between multiple users. This is not the case for MacOS or Windows.\n> \n> Mitigation.\n> \n> Moving to the `Files` API instead will fix this vulnerability. \n> https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#createTempFile-java.nio.file.Path-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...-\n> \n> This API will explicitly set the posix file permissions to something safe, by default.\n> \n> I recently disclosed a similar vulnerability in JUnit 4:\n> https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\n> \n> If you're also curious, this vulnerability in Jetty was also mine, also involving temporary directories, but is not the same vulnerability as in this case.\n> https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-g3wg-6mcf-8jj6\n> \n> I would appreciate it if we could perform disclosure of this vulnerability leveraging the GitHub security advisories feature here. GitHub has a nice credit system that I appreciate, plus the disclosures, as you can see from the sampling above, end up looking very nice.\n> https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories\n> \n> This vulnerability disclosure follows Google's [90-day vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/) (I'm not an employee of Google, I just like their policy). Full disclosure will occur either at the end of the 90-day deadline or whenever a patch is made widely available, whichever occurs first.\n> \n> Cheers,\n> Jonathan Leitschuh\n\n## Related CVE(s)\nCVE-2021-21290, CVE-2022-24823, GHSA-269q-hmxg-m83q", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21290", "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/c735357bf29d07856ad171c6611a2e1a0e0000ec", "https://github.com/netty/netty", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r7bb3cdc192e9a6f863d3ea05422f09fa1ae2b88d4663e63696ee7ef5@%3Cdev.ranger.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r9924ef9357537722b28d04c98a189750b80694a19754e5057c34ca48@%3Ccommits.pulsar.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra0fc2b4553dd7aaf75febb61052b7f1243ac3a180a71c01f29093013@%3Cjira.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra503756ced78fdc2136bd33e87cb7553028645b261b1f5c6186a121e@%3Cjira.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb06c1e766aa45ee422e8261a8249b561784186483e8f742ea627bda4@%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb51d6202ff1a773f96eaa694b7da4ad3f44922c40b3d4e1a19c2f325@%3Ccommits.pulsar.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rb592033a2462548d061a83ac9449c5ff66098751748fcd1e2d008233@%3Cissues.zookeeper.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc0087125cb15b4b78e44000f841cd37fefedfda942fd7ddf3ad1b528@%3Cissues.zookeeper.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc488f80094872ad925f0c73d283d4c00d32def81977438e27a3dc2bb@%3Cjira.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rcd163e421273e8dca1c71ea298dce3dd11b41d51c3a812e0394e6a5d@%3Ccommits.pulsar.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdba4f78ac55f803893a1a2265181595e79e3aa027e2e651dfba98c18@%3Cjira.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/02/msg00016.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220210-0011", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4885", "https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0053443ce19ff125981559f8c51cf66e3ab4350f47812b8cf0733a05@%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r02e467123d45006a1dda20a38349e9c74c3a4b53e2e07be0939ecb3f@%3Cdev.ranger.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0857b613604c696bf9743f0af047360baaded48b1c75cf6945a083c5@%3Cjira.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r10308b625e49d4e9491d7e079606ca0df2f0a4d828f1ad1da64ba47b@%3Cjira.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r1908a34b9cc7120e5c19968a116ddbcffea5e9deb76c2be4fa461904@%3Cdev.zookeeper.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r2748097ea4b774292539cf3de6e3b267fc7a88d6c8ec40f4e2e87bd4@%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r2936730ef0a06e724b96539bc7eacfcd3628987c16b1b99c790e7b87@%3Cissues.zookeeper.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r2fda4dab73097051977f2ab818f75e04fbcb15bb1003c8530eac1059@%3Cjira.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r326ec431f06eab7cb7113a7a338e59731b8d556d05258457f12bac1b@%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r4efed2c501681cb2e8d629da16e48d9eac429624fd4c9a8c6b8e7020@%3Cdev.tinkerpop.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r584cf871f188c406d8bd447ff4e2fd9817fca862436c064d0951a071@%3Ccommits.pulsar.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r59bac5c09f7a4179b9e2460e8f41c278aaf3b9a21cc23678eb893e41@%3Cjira.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r5bf303d7c04da78f276765da08559fdc62420f1df539b277ca31f63b@%3Cissues.zookeeper.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r5c701840aa2845191721e39821445e1e8c59711e71942b7796a6ec29@%3Cusers.activemq.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r5e4a540089760c8ecc2c411309d74264f1dad634ad93ad583ca16214@%3Ccommits.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r5e66e286afb5506cdfe9bbf68a323e8d09614f6d1ddc806ed0224700@%3Cjira.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r71dbb66747ff537640bb91eb0b2b24edef21ac07728097016f58b01f@%3Ccommits.kafka.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r743149dcc8db1de473e6bff0b3ddf10140a7357bc2add75f7d1fbb12@%3Cdev.zookeeper.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r790c2926efcd062067eb18fde2486527596d7275381cfaff2f7b3890@%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

Users that do not override the query mode are not impacted.\n\n# Exploitation\n\nTo exploit this behavior the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. A placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus (i.e. `-`)\n1. There must be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder on the same line. \n1. Both parameters must be user controlled.\n\nThe prior behavior of the driver when operating in simple query mode would inline the negative value of the first parameter and cause the resulting line to be treated as a `--` SQL comment. That would extend to the beginning of the next parameter and cause the quoting of that parameter to be consumed by the comment line. If that string parameter includes a newline, the resulting text would appear unescaped in the resulting SQL.\n\nWhen operating in the default extended query mode this would not be an issue as the parameter values are sent separately to the server. Only in simple query mode the parameter values are inlined into the executed SQL causing this issue.\n\n# Example\n\n```java\nPreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(\"SELECT -?, ?\");\nstmt.setInt(1, -1);\nstmt.setString(2, \"\nWHERE false --\");\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();\n```\n\nThe resulting SQL when operating in simple query mode would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT --1,'\nWHERE false --'\n```\n\nThe contents of the second parameter get injected into the command. Note how both the number of result columns and the WHERE clause of the command have changed. A more elaborate example could execute arbitrary other SQL commands.\n\n# Patch\nProblem will be patched upgrade to 42.7.2, 42.6.1, 42.5.5, 42.4.4, 42.3.9, 42.2.28, 42.2.28.jre7\n\nThe patch fixes the inlining of parameters by forcing them all to be serialized as wrapped literals. The SQL in the prior example would be transformed into:\n\n```sql\nSELECT -('-1'::int4), ('\nWHERE false --')\n```\n\n# Workarounds\nDo not use the connection property`preferQueryMode=simple`. (*NOTE: If you do not explicitly specify a query mode then you are using the default of `extended` and are not impacted by this issue.*)\n\n## Related CVE(s)\nBIT-postgresql-jdbc-driver-2024-1597, CVE-2024-1597", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1597", "https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/06abfb78a627277a580d4df825f210e96a4e14ee", "https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/93b0fcb2711d9c1e3a2a03134369738a02a58b40", "https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible.\n\n### Impact\nSites that accept input HTML from users and use jsoup to sanitize that HTML, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, if they have enabled `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` and do not set an appropriate Content Security Policy.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3.\n\nUsers should upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the updated version.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo remediate this issue without immediately upgrading:\n\n- disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs\n- ensure an appropriate [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is defined. (This should be used regardless of upgrading, as a defence-in-depth best practice.)\n\n### Background and root cause\njsoup includes a [Cleaner](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Cleaner.html) component, which is designed to [sanitize input HTML](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/cleaning-html/safelist-sanitizer) against configurable safe-lists of acceptable tags, attributes, and attribute values.\n\nThis includes removing potentially malicious attributes such as `<a href=\"javascript:...\">`, which may enable XSS attacks. It does this by validating URL attributes against allowed URL protocols (e.g. `http`, `https`).\n\nHowever, an attacker may be able to bypass this check by embedding control characters into the href attribute value. This causes the Java URL class, which is used to resolve relative URLs to absolute URLs before checking the URL's protocol, to treat the URL as a relative URL. It is then resolved into an absolute URL with the configured base URI.\n\nFor example, `java\tscript:...` would resolve to `https://example.com/java\tscript:...`.\n\nBy default, when using a safe-list that allows `a` tags, jsoup will rewrite any relative URLs (e.g. `/foo/`) to an absolute URL (e.g. `https://example.com/foo/`). Therefore, this attack attempt would be successfully mitigated. However, if the option [SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks](https://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/safety/Safelist.html#preserveRelativeLinks(boolean)) is enabled (which does not rewrite relative links to absolute), the input is left as-is.\n\nWhile Java will treat a path like `java\tscript:` as a relative path, as it does not match the allowed characters of a URL spec, browsers may normalize out the control characters, and subsequently evaluate it as a `javascript:` spec inline expression. That disparity then leads to an XSS opportunity.\n\nSites defining a Content Security Policy that does not allow javascript expressions in link URLs will not be impacted, as the policy will prevent the script's execution.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup)\n* Email the author of jsoup at [jonathan@hedley.net](mailto:jonathan@hedley.net)\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Jens H\u00e4derer, who reported this issue, and contributed to its resolution.", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36033", "https://github.com/jhy/jsoup", "https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases/tag/jsoup-1.15.3", "https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.15.3", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0006"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

In cases where the hostname is greater than 255 characters in length, curl will instead attempt to perform the resolution locally and then pass the resolved IP to the proxy for its use. Due to an issue in the curl source code, the logic that determines whether curl should resolve the name locally or pass it to the proxy for resolution could make an incorrect decision when a slow SOCKS5 handshake occurs. If this occurs, curl may inadvertently copy an excessively long host name, rather than the resolved address, into the target buffer being prepared for transmission to the proxy, resulting in a buffer overflow.", "related_urls": ["http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38545", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38546"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n\nThese are the prerequisites for the exploit:\n- JDK 9 or higher\n- Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container\n- Packaged as WAR\n- `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency\n\n## Patches\n\n- Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE)\n- Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)\n\n## Workarounds\n\nFor those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.\n\nTo apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization. In order to do that, a Spring Boot application can declare a `WebMvcRegistrations` bean (Spring MVC) or a `WebFluxRegistrations` bean (Spring WebFlux).", "related_urls": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22965", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/002546b3e4b8d791ea6acccb81eb3168f51abb15", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-254054.pdf", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18", "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0005", "https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement", "https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-java-spring-rce-Zx9GUc67", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166713/Spring4Shell-Code-Execution.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167011/Spring4Shell-Spring-Framework-Class-Property-Remote-Code-Execution.html"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

Spring Boot applications that depend on spring-boot-starter-web or spring-boot-starter-webflux are ready to serve static resources out of the box and are therefore vulnerable.", "related_urls": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15756", "https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html", "https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html", "https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2019-5072813.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html", "https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html", "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-15756", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/04/msg00022.html", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f8905507a2c94af6b08b72d7be0c4b8c6660e585f00abfafeccc86bc@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/efaa52b0aa67aae7cbd9e6ef96945387e422d7ce0e65434570a37b1d@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d6a84f52db89804b0ad965f3ea2b24bb880edee29107a1c5069cc3dd@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/bb354962cb51fff65740d5fb1bc2aac56af577c06244b57c36f98e4d@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/a3071e11c6fbd593022074ec1b4693f6d948c2b02cfa4a5d854aed68@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/8a1fe70534fc52ff5c9db5ac29c55657f802cbefd7e9d9850c7052bd@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/7b156ee50ba3ecce87b33c06bf7a749d84ffee55e69bfb5eca88fcc3@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/77886fec378ee6064debb1efb6b464a4a0173b2ff0d151ed86d3a228@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/339fd112517e4873695b5115b96acdddbfc8f83b10598528d37c7d12@%3Cissues.activemq.apache.org%3E", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105703"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

header of this ciphertext is:\n\t``` {\"alg\":\"RSA1_5\",\"enc\":\"A128GCM\"}```\nHence the algorithm in the header does not match the algorithm in the key. Such ciphertexts should be rejected. The wrapped key is a valid RSA1_5 encrypted key. jose4j currently decrypts the ciphertext above without an exception. The problem with this behavior is that jose4j also allows chosen ciphertext attacks when the key uses RSA_OAEP. The attacker simply has to modify the header to and replace the algorithm with RSA1_5. Attempts to decrypt modified ciphertexts will then leak whether the decrypted message has valid PKCS #1 padding.\n\n\n### Further Analysis\nFix Commit - https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/commits/63b86581e7bfcc2d9d04ee15caea4b5bfb911f59\n\n\n\n### Timeline\n**Date reported**: 01/27/2023\n**Date fixed**: 02/09/2023\n**Date disclosed**: 04/27/2023", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-jgvc-jfgh-rjvv", "https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/commits/14e62a8dee9decb4ff6e0625aedc5724601bfdb6", "https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/commits/63b86581e7bfcc2d9d04ee15caea4b5bfb911f59", "https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/commits/tag/jose4j-0.9.3", "https://github.com/google/security-research"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

The issue occurs because curl's HSTS check can be bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP. Using its HSTS support, it can instruct curl to use HTTPS directly instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism can be bypassed if the hostname in the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`.\n\nCVE-2022-42915:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs if curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL. It sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a `CONNECT` request to the proxy and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 response code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double-free issue in curl if using one of the following schemes in the URL for the transfer: `dict,` `gopher,` `gophers,` `ldap`, `ldaps`, `rtmp`, `rtmps`, `telnet.`\n\nCVE-2022-35260:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs when curl is told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file ends in a line with consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curl could read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the read works, it can write a zero byte beyond its boundary. This issue, in most cases, causes a segfault or similar problem. A denial of service can occur if a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents.\n\nCVE-2022-32221:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs when doing HTTP(S) transfers, where curl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set if it previously used the same handle to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request.", "related_urls": ["http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32221", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35260", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-42915", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-42916"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

`foo.txt`, In-this case I noticed that there's no validation at all on the amount of folders being created, that said we're actually able to CPU and memory consume the system running node-tar and even

The verify method in `IdTokenVerifier` does not validate the signature before verifying the claims (e.g., iss, aud, etc.). Signature verification makes sure that the token's payload comes from valid provider, not from someone else.\n\nAn attacker can provide a compromised token with modified payload like email or phone number. The token will pass the validation by the library. Once verified, modified payload can be used by the application. \n\nIf the application sends verified `IdToken` to other service as is like for auth - the risk is low, because the backend of the service is expected to check the signature and fail the request. \n\nReporter: [Tamjid al Rahat](https://github.com/tamjidrahat), contributor\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was fixed in the 1.33.3 version of the library\n\n### Proof of Concept\nTo reproduce, one needs to call the verify function with an IdToken instance that contains a malformed signature to successfully bypass the checks inside the verify function.\n\n```\n\t/** A default http transport factory for testing */\n\tstatic class DefaultHttpTransportFactory implements HttpTransportFactory {\n\t\tpublic HttpTransport create() {\n\t\t\treturn new NetHttpTransport();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n// The below token has some modified bits in the signature\n private static final String SERVICE_ACCOUNT_RS256_TOKEN_BAD_SIGNATURE =\t\t\n\"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjJlZjc3YjM4YTFiMDM3MDQ4NzA0MzkxNmFjYmYyN2Q3NG\" +\n\"VkZDA4YjEiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJhdWQiOiJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUuY29tL2F1ZGllbm\" +\n\"NlIiwiZXhwIjoxNTg3NjMwNTQzLCJpYXQiOjE1ODc2MjY5NDMsImlzcyI6InNvbWUgaXNzdWVy\" +\n\"Iiwic3ViIjoic29tZSBzdWJqZWN0In0.gGOQW0qQgs4jGUmCsgRV83RqsJLaEy89-ZOG6p1u0Y26\" +\n\"FyY06b6Odgd7xXLsSTiiSnch62dl0Lfi9D0x2ByxvsGOCbovmBl2ZZ0zHr1wpc4N0XS9lMUq5RJ\" + \n\"QbonDibxXG4nC2zroDfvD0h7i-L8KMXeJb9pYwW7LkmrM_YwYfJnWnZ4bpcsDjojmPeUBlACg7tjjOgBFby\" +\n\"QZvUtaERJwSRlaWibvNjof7eCVfZChE0PwBpZc_cGqSqKXv544L4ttqdCnm0NjqrTATXwC4gYx\" + \n\"ruevkjHfYI5ojcQmXoWDJJ0-_jzfyPE4MFFdCFgzLgnfIOwe5ve0MtquKuv2O0pgvg\";\n\nIdTokenVerifier tokenVerifier =\n\t\t\t\tnew IdTokenVerifier.Builder()\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.setClock(clock)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.setCertificatesLocation(\"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/integration-tests%40chingor-test.iam.gserviceaccount.com\")\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.setHttpTransportFactory(new DefaultHttpTransportFactory())\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.build();\n\n// verification will return true despite modified signature for versions <1.33.3\ntokenVerifier.verify(IdToken.parse(GsonFactory.getDefaultInstance(), SERVICE_ACCOUNT_RS256_TOKEN_BAD_SIGNATURE));\n\n```\n\n### Remediation and Mitigation\nUpdate to the version 1.33.3 or higher \n\nIf the library used indirectly or cannot be updated for any reason you can use similar IdToken verifiers provided by Google that already has signature verification. For example: \n[google-auth-library-java](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-java/blob/main/oauth2_http/java/com/google/auth/oauth2/TokenVerifier.java)\n[google-api-java-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-java-client/blob/main/google-api-client/src/main/java/com/google/api/client/googleapis/auth/oauth2/GoogleIdTokenVerifier.java)\n\n### Timeline\nDate reported: 12 Dec 2021\nDate fixed: 13 Apr 2022\nDate disclosed: 2 May 2022\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [google-oauth-java-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client) repo", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client/security/advisories/GHSA-hw42-3568-wj87", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22573", "https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client/pull/872", "https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client/commit/c634ad4e31cac322bb1aa8a9feb0569749011bf0", "https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

This security flaw happens when curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from an HTTP(S) server, where it accepts cookies using control codes (byte values below 32), and also when cookies that contain such control codes are later sent back to an HTTP(S) server, possibly causing the server to return a 400 response. This issue effectively allows a \"sister site\" to deny service to siblings and cause a denial of service attack.\n\nCVE-2022-32208:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because it mishandles message verification failures when curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-in-the-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows data injection into the client.\n\nCVE-2022-32207:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when curl saves cookies, alt-svc, and HSTS data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the process with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name. This flaw leads to unpreserved file permissions, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32206:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the number of acceptable \"links\" in the \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32205:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because a malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in an HTTP response to curl, which stores all of them. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-30115:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when using its HTTP Strict Transport Security(HSTS) support, it can instruct curl to use HTTPS directly instead of using an insecure clear text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This flaw leads to a clear text transmission of sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2022-27782:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because curl can reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or SSH-related option is changed that should have prohibited reuse. This flaw leads to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-27780:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators like / when decoding the hostname part of a URL, making it a different URL using the wrong hostname when it is later retrieved. This flaw allows a malicious actor to make circumventing filters.\n\nCVE-2022-27779:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs because curl wrongly allows HTTP cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs) if the hostname is provided with a trailing dot. This flaw allows arbitrary sites to set cookies that get sent to a different and unrelated site or domain by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-27776:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the same host but another port number. Sending the same set of headers to a server on a different port number is a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` or `Cookie:`headers. Those headers often contain privacy-sensitive information or data.\n\nCVE-2022-27775:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw occurs due to errors in the logic where the config matching function did not take the IPv6 address zone id into account. This issue can lead to curl reusing the wrong connection when one transfer uses a zone id, and the subsequent transfer uses another.\n\nCVE-2022-27774:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows leaking credentials to other servers when it follows redirects from auth-protected HTTP(S) URLs to other protocols and port numbers.\n\nCVE-2022-22576:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows reusing OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly ensuring that the connection was authenticated with the same credentials set for this transfer. This issue leads to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.", "related_urls": ["http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-22576", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27774", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27775", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27776", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27779", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27780", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27782", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-30115", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32205", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32206", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32207", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32208", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35252"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}
