This flaw leads to unpreserved file permissions, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32206:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the number of acceptable \"links\" in the \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32205:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because a malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in an HTTP response to curl, which stores all of them. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-30115:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when using its HTTP Strict Transport Security(HSTS) support, it can instruct curl to use HTTPS directly instead of using an insecure clear text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This flaw leads to a clear text transmission of sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2022-27782:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because curl can reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or SSH-related option is changed that should have prohibited reuse. This flaw leads to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-27780:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators like / when decoding the hostname part of a URL, making it a different URL using the wrong hostname when it is later retrieved. This flaw allows a malicious actor to make circumventing filters.\n\nCVE-2022-27779:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs because curl wrongly allows HTTP cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs) if the hostname is provided with a trailing dot. This flaw allows arbitrary sites to set cookies that get sent to a different and unrelated site or domain by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-27776:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the same host but another port number. Sending the same set of headers to a server on a different port number is a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` or `Cookie:`headers. Those headers often contain privacy-sensitive information or data.\n\nCVE-2022-27775:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw occurs due to errors in the logic where the config matching function did not take the IPv6 address zone id into account. This issue can lead to curl reusing the wrong connection when one transfer uses a zone id, and the subsequent transfer uses another.\n\nCVE-2022-27774:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows leaking credentials to other servers when it follows redirects from auth-protected HTTP(S) URLs to other protocols and port numbers.\n\nCVE-2022-22576:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows reusing OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly ensuring that the connection was authenticated with the same credentials set for this transfer. This issue leads to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.", "related_urls": ["http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-22576", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27774", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27775", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27776", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27779", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27780", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27782", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-30115", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32205", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32206", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32207", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32208", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35252"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x.

The issue occurs because curl's HSTS check can be bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP. Using its HSTS support, it can instruct curl to use HTTPS directly instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism can be bypassed if the hostname in the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`.\n\nCVE-2022-42915:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs if curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL. It sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a `CONNECT` request to the proxy and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 response code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double-free issue in curl if using one of the following schemes in the URL for the transfer: `dict,` `gopher,` `gophers,` `ldap`, `ldaps`, `rtmp`, `rtmps`, `telnet.`\n\nCVE-2022-35260:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs when curl is told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file ends in a line with consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curl could read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the read works, it can write a zero byte beyond its boundary. This issue, in most cases, causes a segfault or similar problem. A denial of service can occur if a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents.\n\nCVE-2022-32221:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs when doing HTTP(S) transfers, where curl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set if it previously used the same handle to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request.", "related_urls": ["http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32221", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35260", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-42915", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-42916"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

If a duplicated transfer's easy_handle has cookies enabled when it is duplicated, the cookie-enabled state is cloned but the actual cookies are not. If the source easy_handle didn't read cookies from disk, the cloned easy_handle will attempt to read cookies from a file named 'none' in the local directory, potentially allowing arbitrary cookies to be loaded.\n\nCVE-2023-38545:\n\tAn issue was found in curl that can cause a buffer overflow in its SOCKS5 proxy communications code.\n\nWhen curl is using a SOCKS5 proxy and it needs to resolve a hostname to an IP address, its default behavior is to pass the hostname to the proxy and allow it to perform the resolution. In cases where the hostname is greater than 255 characters in length, curl will instead attempt to perform the resolution locally and then pass the resolved IP to the proxy for its use. Due to an issue in the curl source code, the logic that determines whether curl should resolve the name locally or pass it to the proxy for resolution could make an incorrect decision when a slow SOCKS5 handshake occurs.

If a duplicated transfer's easy_handle has cookies enabled when it is duplicated, the cookie-enabled state is cloned but the actual cookies are not.

In cases where the hostname is greater than 255 characters in length, curl will instead attempt to perform the resolution locally and then pass the resolved IP to the proxy for its use. Due to an issue in the curl source code, the logic that determines whether curl should resolve the name locally or pass it to the proxy for resolution could make an incorrect decision when a slow SOCKS5 handshake occurs.

The issue occurs because curl's HSTS check can be bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP. Using its HSTS support, it can instruct curl to use HTTPS directly instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism can be bypassed if the hostname in the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`.\n\nCVE-2022-42915:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs if curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL. It sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a `CONNECT` request to the proxy and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 response code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double-free issue in curl if using one of the following schemes in the URL for the transfer: `dict,` `gopher,` `gophers,` `ldap`, `ldaps`, `rtmp`, `rtmps`, `telnet.`\n\nCVE-2022-35260:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs when curl is told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file ends in a line with consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curl could read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the read works, it can write a zero byte beyond its boundary. This issue, in most cases, causes a segfault or similar problem. A denial of service can occur if a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents.\n\nCVE-2022-32221:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs when doing HTTP(S) transfers, where curl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set if it previously used the same handle to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the subsequent `POST` request.", "related_urls": ["http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32221", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35260", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-42915", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-42916"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

This security flaw happens when curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from an HTTP(S) server, where it accepts cookies using control codes (byte values below 32), and also when cookies that contain such control codes are later sent back to an HTTP(S) server, possibly causing the server to return a 400 response. This issue effectively allows a \"sister site\" to deny service to siblings and cause a denial of service attack.\n\nCVE-2022-32208:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because it mishandles message verification failures when curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-in-the-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows data injection into the client.\n\nCVE-2022-32207:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when curl saves cookies, alt-svc, and HSTS data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the process with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name. This flaw leads to unpreserved file permissions, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32206:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl.

This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32205:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl.

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.\n\n```js\nconst path = require('path')\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n\tfile: 'archive.tgz',\n\t// either add this function...\n\tonentry: (entry) => {\n\t\tif (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n\t\t\tentry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)\n\t\t\tentry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\n\t// or this one\n\tfilter: (file, entry) => {\n\t\tif (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n\t\t\treturn false\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\treturn true\n\t\t}\n\t}\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32804", "https://github.com/npm/node-tar/commit/1f036ca23f64a547bdd6c79c1a44bc62e8115da4", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf", "https://github.com/npm/node-tar", "https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1770", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

This issue occurs because it mishandles message verification failures when curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-in-the-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows data injection into the client.\n\nCVE-2022-32207:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when curl saves cookies, alt-svc, and HSTS data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the process with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name. This flaw leads to unpreserved file permissions, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32206:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the number of acceptable \"links\" in the \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32205:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because a malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in an HTTP response to curl, which stores all of them. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-30115:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when using its HTTP Strict Transport Security(HSTS) support, it can instruct curl to use HTTPS directly instead of using an insecure clear text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This flaw leads to a clear text transmission of sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2022-27782:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because curl can reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or SSH-related option is changed that should have prohibited reuse. This flaw leads to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-27780:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators like / when decoding the hostname part of a URL, making it a different URL using the wrong hostname when it is later retrieved. This flaw allows a malicious actor to make circumventing filters.\n\nCVE-2022-27779:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs because curl wrongly allows HTTP cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs) if the hostname is provided with a trailing dot. This flaw allows arbitrary sites to set cookies that get sent to a different and unrelated site or domain by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-27776:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the same host but another port number. Sending the same set of headers to a server on a different port number is a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` or `Cookie:`headers. Those headers often contain privacy-sensitive information or data.\n\nCVE-2022-27775:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw occurs due to errors in the logic where the config matching function did not take the IPv6 address zone id into account. This issue can lead to curl reusing the wrong connection when one transfer uses a zone id, and the subsequent transfer uses another.\n\nCVE-2022-27774:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows leaking credentials to other servers when it follows redirects from auth-protected HTTP(S) URLs to other protocols and port numbers.\n\nCVE-2022-22576:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows reusing OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly ensuring that the connection was authenticated with the same credentials set for this transfer. This issue leads to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.", "related_urls": ["http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-22576", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27774", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27775", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27776", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27779", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27780", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27782", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-30115", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32205", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32206", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32207", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32208", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35252"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}
