Such changes can potentially lead to XSS attacks (if a fully-qualified URL is used in links) and/or URL poisoning.\n\n### Patches\n\nAny version after 2.11.0.\n\nStarting in laminas/laminas-diactoros 2.11.1, we have added `Laminas\\Diactoros\\ServerRequestFilter\\FilterServerRequestInterface`, which defines the single method `__invoke(Psr\\Http\\Message\\ServerRequestInterface $request): Psr\\Http\\Message\\ServerRequestInterface`. Filters implementing this interface allow modifying and returning a generated `ServerRequest`.\n\nThe primary use case of the interface is to allow modifying the generated URI based on the presence of headers such as `X-Forwarded-Host`. When operating behind a reverse proxy, the `Host` header is often rewritten to the name of the node to which the request is being forwarded, and an `X-Forwarded-Host` header is generated with the original `Host` value to allow the server to determine the original host the request was intended for. (We have always examined the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header; as of Diactoros 2.11.1, we also examine the `X-Forwarded-Port` header.) To accommodate this use case, we created Laminas\\Diactoros\\ServerRequestFilter\\FilterUsingXForwardedHeaders.\n\nDue to potential security issues, it is generally best to only accept these headers if you trust the reverse proxy that has initiated the request.\n(This value is found in `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`, which is present as `$request->getServerParams()['REMOTE_ADDR']` within PSR-7 implementations.) `FilterUsingXForwardedHeaders` provides named constructors to allow you to trust these headers from any source (which has been the default behavior of Diactoros since the beginning), or to specify specific IP addresses or CIDR subnets to trust, along with which headers are trusted.\n\n`Laminas\\Diactoros\\ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals()` was updated to accept a `FilterServerRequestInterface` as an additional, optional argument. Since the `X-Forwarded-*` headers do have valid use cases, particularly in clustered environments using a load balancer, to prevent backwards compatibility breaks, if no filter is provided, we generate an instance via `FilterUsingXForwardedHeaders::trustReservedSubnets()`, which generates an instance marked to trust only proxies on private subnets.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nInfrastructure or DevOps can configure web servers to reject `X-Forwarded-*` headers at the web server level.\n\nUsers of laminas/laminas-diactoros can make use of the `Laminas\\Diactoros\\RequestFilter\\RequestFilterInterface` functionality in order to either (a) disable usage of the `X-Forwarded-*` headers entirely, (b) opt-in to it, or (c) opt-in to the usage for configured proxy servers.\n\n### References\n\n- [HTTP Host Header Attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open an issue in [laminas/laminas-diactoros](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros/)\n- [Email us](mailto:security@getlaminas.org)", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros/security/advisories/GHSA-8274-h5jp-97vr", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31109", "https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros/commit/25b11d422c2e5dad868f68619888763b30f91e2d", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/laminas/laminas-diactoros/CVE-2022-31109.yaml", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8274-h5jp-97vr", "https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros", "https://github.com/laminas/laminas-diactoros/releases/tag/2.11.1", "https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level.

The libcurl provided function, curl_easy_duphandle(), is used to duplicate the easy_handle associated with a transfer. If a duplicated transfer's easy_handle has cookies enabled when it is duplicated, the cookie-enabled state is cloned but the actual cookies are not. If the source easy_handle didn't read cookies from disk, the cloned easy_handle will attempt to read cookies from a file named 'none' in the local directory, potentially allowing arbitrary cookies to be loaded.\n\nCVE-2023-38545:\n\tAn issue was found in curl that can cause a buffer overflow in its SOCKS5 proxy communications code.\n\nWhen curl is using a SOCKS5 proxy and it needs to resolve a hostname to an IP address, its default behavior is to pass the hostname to the proxy and allow it to perform the resolution. In cases where the hostname is greater than 255 characters in length, curl will instead attempt to perform the resolution locally and then pass the resolved IP to the proxy for its use. Due to an issue in the curl source code, the logic that determines whether curl should resolve the name locally or pass it to the proxy for resolution could make an incorrect decision when a slow SOCKS5 handshake occurs. If this occurs, curl may inadvertently copy an excessively long host name, rather than the resolved address, into the target buffer being prepared for transmission to the proxy, resulting in a buffer overflow.", "related_urls": ["http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38545", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38546"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

In its API, an application creates \"easy handles\"\nthat are the individual handles for single transfers.\n\nlibcurl provides a function call that duplicates en easy handle called\n[curl_easy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html).\n\nIf a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, the\ncookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the actual\ncookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific file on\ndisk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the file name as\n`none` (using the four ASCII letters, no quotes).\n\nSubsequent use of the cloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to\nload cookies from would then inadvertently load cookies from a file named\n`none` - if such a file exists and is readable in the current directory of the\nprogram using libcurl. And if using the correct file format of course.\n", "related_urls": ["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/34", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/37", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/38", "https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38546.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OGMXNRNSJ4ETDK6FRNU3J7SABXPWCHSQ/", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214036", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214057", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214058", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214063"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}
