However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295\nwill overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered.

This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server.

Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism. If Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `\"` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered. So, a cookie header such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE=\"b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d\"` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server or its logging system.

Users that do not override the query mode are not impacted.\n\n# Exploitation\n\nTo exploit this behavior the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. A placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus (i.e. `-`)\n1. There must be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder on the same line. \n1. Both parameters must be user controlled.\n\nThe prior behavior of the driver when operating in simple query mode would inline the negative value of the first parameter and cause the resulting line to be treated as a `--` SQL comment. That would extend to the beginning of the next parameter and cause the quoting of that parameter to be consumed by the comment line. If that string parameter includes a newline, the resulting text would appear unescaped in the resulting SQL.\n\nWhen operating in the default extended query mode this would not be an issue as the parameter values are sent separately to the server. Only in simple query mode the parameter values are inlined into the executed SQL causing this issue.\n\n# Example\n\n```java\nPreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(\"SELECT -?, ?\");\nstmt.setInt(1, -1);\nstmt.setString(2, \"\nWHERE false --\");\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();\n```\n\nThe resulting SQL when operating in simple query mode would be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT --1,'\nWHERE false --'\n```\n\nThe contents of the second parameter get injected into the command. Note how both the number of result columns and the WHERE clause of the command have changed. A more elaborate example could execute arbitrary other SQL commands.\n\n# Patch\nProblem will be patched upgrade to 42.7.2, 42.6.1, 42.5.5, 42.4.4, 42.3.9, 42.2.28, 42.2.28.jre7\n\nThe patch fixes the inlining of parameters by forcing them all to be serialized as wrapped literals. The SQL in the prior example would be transformed into:\n\n```sql\nSELECT -('-1'::int4), ('\nWHERE false --')\n```\n\n# Workarounds\nDo not use the connection property`preferQueryMode=simple`. (*NOTE: If you do not explicitly specify a query mode then you are using the default of `extended` and are not impacted by this issue.*)\n\n## Related CVE(s)\nBIT-postgresql-jdbc-driver-2024-1597, CVE-2024-1597", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/security/advisories/GHSA-24rp-q3w6-vc56", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1597", "https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/06abfb78a627277a580d4df825f210e96a4e14ee", "https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/93b0fcb2711d9c1e3a2a03134369738a02a58b40", "https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}
