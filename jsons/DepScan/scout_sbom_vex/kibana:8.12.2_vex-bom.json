This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

The libcurl provided function, curl_easy_duphandle(), is used to duplicate the easy_handle associated with a transfer. If a duplicated transfer's easy_handle has cookies enabled when it is duplicated, the cookie-enabled state is cloned but the actual cookies are not. If the source easy_handle didn't read cookies from disk, the cloned easy_handle will attempt to read cookies from a file named 'none' in the local directory, potentially allowing arbitrary cookies to be loaded.\n\nCVE-2023-38545:\n\tAn issue was found in curl that can cause a buffer overflow in its SOCKS5 proxy communications code.\n\nWhen curl is using a SOCKS5 proxy and it needs to resolve a hostname to an IP address, its default behavior is to pass the hostname to the proxy and allow it to perform the resolution. In cases where the hostname is greater than 255 characters in length, curl will instead attempt to perform the resolution locally and then pass the resolved IP to the proxy for its use. Due to an issue in the curl source code, the logic that determines whether curl should resolve the name locally or pass it to the proxy for resolution could make an incorrect decision when a slow SOCKS5 handshake occurs. If this occurs, curl may inadvertently copy an excessively long host name, rather than the resolved address, into the target buffer being prepared for transmission to the proxy, resulting in a buffer overflow.", "related_urls": ["http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38545", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38546"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure.

When verifying an ocsp response with the \"-no_cert_checks\" option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed.

This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).", "related_urls": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1434.html", "https://bugzilla.suse.com/1199168"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded (or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function. Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue.

Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible.

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability).

This security flaw happens when curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from an HTTP(S) server, where it accepts cookies using control codes (byte values below 32), and also when cookies that contain such control codes are later sent back to an HTTP(S) server, possibly causing the server to return a 400 response. This issue effectively allows a \"sister site\" to deny service to siblings and cause a denial of service attack.\n\nCVE-2022-32208:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because it mishandles message verification failures when curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-in-the-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows data injection into the client.\n\nCVE-2022-32207:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when curl saves cookies, alt-svc, and HSTS data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the process with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name. This flaw leads to unpreserved file permissions, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32206:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the number of acceptable \"links\" in the \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32205:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl.

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.

The issue occurs because curl's HSTS check can be bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP. Using its HSTS support, it can instruct curl to use HTTPS directly instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism can be bypassed if the hostname in the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`.\n\nCVE-2022-42915:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs if curl is told to use an HTTP proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL. It sets up the connection to the remote server by issuing a `CONNECT` request to the proxy and then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead return a non-200 response code to the client. Due to flaws in the error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double-free issue in curl if using one of the following schemes in the URL for the transfer: `dict,` `gopher,` `gophers,` `ldap`, `ldaps`, `rtmp`, `rtmps`, `telnet.`\n\nCVE-2022-35260:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs when curl is told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file ends in a line with consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curl could read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the read works, it can write a zero byte beyond its boundary. This issue, in most cases, causes a segfault or similar problem. A denial of service can occur if a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents.\n\nCVE-2022-32221:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs when doing HTTP(S) transfers, where curl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set if it previously used the same handle to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback.

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.\n\n```js\nconst path = require('path')\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n\tfile: 'archive.tgz',\n\t// either add this function...\n\tonentry: (entry) => {\n\t\tif (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n\t\t\tentry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)\n\t\t\tentry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\n\t// or this one\n\tfilter: (file, entry) => {\n\t\tif (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n\t\t\treturn false\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\treturn true\n\t\t}\n\t}\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32804", "https://github.com/npm/node-tar/commit/1f036ca23f64a547bdd6c79c1a44bc62e8115da4", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf", "https://github.com/npm/node-tar", "https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1770", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

This security flaw happens when curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from an HTTP(S) server, where it accepts cookies using control codes (byte values below 32), and also when cookies that contain such control codes are later sent back to an HTTP(S) server, possibly causing the server to return a 400 response. This issue effectively allows a \"sister site\" to deny service to siblings and cause a denial of service attack.\n\nCVE-2022-32208:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because it mishandles message verification failures when curl does FTP transfers secured by krb5. This flaw makes it possible for a Man-in-the-middle attack to go unnoticed and allows data injection into the client.\n\nCVE-2022-32207:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when curl saves cookies, alt-svc, and HSTS data to local files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the process with a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name. This flaw leads to unpreserved file permissions, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32206:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the number of acceptable \"links\" in the \"decompression chain\" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-32205:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because a malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in an HTTP response to curl, which stores all of them. This flaw leads to a denial of service, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-30115:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because when using its HTTP Strict Transport Security(HSTS) support, it can instruct curl to use HTTPS directly instead of using an insecure clear text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This flaw leads to a clear text transmission of sensitive information.\n\nCVE-2022-27782:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because curl can reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or SSH-related option is changed that should have prohibited reuse. This flaw leads to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-27780:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This issue occurs because the curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators like / when decoding the hostname part of a URL, making it a different URL using the wrong hostname when it is later retrieved. This flaw allows a malicious actor to make circumventing filters.\n\nCVE-2022-27779:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. The issue occurs because curl wrongly allows HTTP cookies to be set for Top Level Domains (TLDs) if the hostname is provided with a trailing dot. This flaw allows arbitrary sites to set cookies that get sent to a different and unrelated site or domain by a malicious actor.\n\nCVE-2022-27776:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to the same host but another port number. Sending the same set of headers to a server on a different port number is a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` or `Cookie:`headers. Those headers often contain privacy-sensitive information or data.\n\nCVE-2022-27775:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw occurs due to errors in the logic where the config matching function did not take the IPv6 address zone id into account. This issue can lead to curl reusing the wrong connection when one transfer uses a zone id, and the subsequent transfer uses another.\n\nCVE-2022-27774:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows leaking credentials to other servers when it follows redirects from auth-protected HTTP(S) URLs to other protocols and port numbers.\n\nCVE-2022-22576:\n\tA vulnerability was found in curl. This security flaw allows reusing OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly ensuring that the connection was authenticated with the same credentials set for this transfer. This issue leads to an authentication bypass, either by mistake or by a malicious actor.", "related_urls": ["http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-22576", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27774", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27775", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27776", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27779", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27780", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27782", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-30115", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32205", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32206", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32207", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-32208", "http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35252"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}
