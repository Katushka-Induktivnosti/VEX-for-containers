For its most basic functionality, this endpoint receives a repository URL, and Jenkins will schedule polling for all jobs configured with the specified repository. In Git Plugin 4.11.3 and earlier, this endpoint can be accessed with GET requests and without authentication. In addition to this basic functionality, the endpoint also accept a `sha1` parameter specifying a commit ID. If this parameter is specified, jobs configured with the specified repo will be triggered immediately, and the build will check out the specified commit. Additionally, the output of the webhook endpoint will provide information about which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs the user has no permission to access. This allows attackers with knowledge of Git repository URLs to trigger builds of jobs using a specified Git repository and to cause them to check out an attacker-specified commit, and to obtain information about the existence of jobs configured with this Git repository. Git Plugin 4.11.4 requires a `token` parameter which will act as an authentication for the webhook endpoint. While GET requests remain allowed, attackers would need to be able to provide a webhook token.

For its most basic functionality, this endpoint receives a repository URL, and Jenkins will schedule polling for all jobs configured with the specified repository. In Git Plugin 4.11.3 and earlier, this endpoint can be accessed with GET requests and without authentication. In addition to this basic functionality, the endpoint also accept a `sha1` parameter specifying a commit ID. If this parameter is specified, jobs configured with the specified repo will be triggered immediately, and the build will check out the specified commit. Additionally, the output of the webhook endpoint will provide information about which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs the user has no permission to access. This allows attackers with knowledge of Git repository URLs to trigger builds of jobs using a specified Git repository and to cause them to check out an attacker-specified commit, and to obtain information about the existence of jobs configured with this Git repository. Additionally, this webhook endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. Git Plugin 4.11.4 requires a `token` parameter which will act as an authentication for the webhook endpoint. While GET requests remain allowed, attackers would need to be able to provide a webhook token.

folder creation process, Basicly if you provide node-tar with a path like this `./a/b/c/foo.txt` it would create every folder and sub-folder here a, b and c until it reaches the last folder to create `foo.txt`, In-this case I noticed that there's no validation at all on the amount of folders being created, that said we're actually able to CPU and memory consume the system running node-tar and even crash the nodejs client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nYou can reproduce this issue by downloading the tar file I provided in the resources and using node-tar to extract it, you should get the same behavior as the video\n\n## Proof Of Concept:\nHere's a

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths.

Versions earlier than 4.0 resolved those references automatically. While this by itself doesn't cause much of a security problem, a denial of service can happen if those references are deeply nested and used multiple times (so that the same reference to the same object occurs multiple times), and if the decoded CBOR object is sent to a serialization method such as EncodeToBytes, ToString, or ToJSONString, since the objects referred to are expanded in the process and take up orders of magnitude more memory than if the references weren't resolved.\n\nThe impact of this problem on any particular system varies. In general, the risk is higher if the system allows users to send arbitrary CBOR objects without authentication, or exposes a remote endpoint in which arbitrary CBOR objects can be sent without authentication.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem is addressed in version 4.0 by disabling reference resolution by default. Users should use the latest version of this library.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSince version 3.6, an encoding option (`resolvereferences=true` or `resolvereferences=false`) in CBOREncodeOptions sets whether the CBOR processor will resolve these kinds of references when decoding a CBOR object. Set `resolvereferences=false` to disable reference resolution.\n\nIn version 3.6, if the method used CBORObject.Read() or CBORObject.DecodeFromBytes() to decode a serialized CBOR object, call the overload that takes CBOREncodeOptions as follows:\n\n\t\tCBORObject.DecodeFromBytes(bytes, new CBOREncodeOptions(\"resolvereferences=false\"));\n\nIn versions 3.5 and earlier, this issue is present only if the CBOR object is an array or a map. If the application does not expect a decoded CBOR object to be an array or a map, it should check the CBOR object's type before encoding that object, as follows:\n\n\t\tif (cbor.Type != CBORType.Array && cbor.Type != CBORType.Map) {\n\t\t\t cbor.EncodeToBytes();\n\t\t}\n\nAlternatively, for such versions, the application can use WriteTo to decode the CBOR object to a so-called \"limited memory stream\", that is, a Stream that throws an exception if too many bytes would be written. How to write such a limited-memory stream is nontrivial and beyond the scope of this advisory.\n\n\t\tLimitedMemoryStream stream = new LimitedMemoryStream(100000); // Limit to 100000 bytes\n\t\tcbor.WriteTo(stream);\n\t\treturn stream.ToBytes();\n\nTo check whether a byte array representing a CBOR object might exhibit this problem, check whether the array contains the byte 0xd8 followed immediately by either 0x19 or 0x1d. This check catches all affected CBOR objects but may catch some non-affected CBOR objects (notably integers and byte strings).\n\n### References\n\nSee the Wikipedia article [Billion laughs attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack) and the related issue in [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/83253).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, open an issue in [the CBOR repository](https://github.com/peteroupc/cbor-java).", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR-Java/security/advisories/GHSA-mm44-wc5p-wqhq", "https://github.com/peteroupc/CBOR-Java"], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}

This private wildcard matching function would match IDN (International Domain Name) hosts incorrectly and could as a result accept patterns that otherwise should mismatch.\n\nIDN hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate checks. Puny coded names always start with xn-- and should not be allowed to pattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could still check for x*, which would match even though the IDN name most likely contained nothing even resembling an x.\n\nCVE-2023-28319:\n\tlibcurl offers a feature to verify an SSH server's public key using a SHA 256 hash.

It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.

Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability).
